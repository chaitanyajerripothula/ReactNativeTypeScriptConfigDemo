# React Native TypeScript Config Demo

A demomnstration project to accompany my blog post RE [Setting up React Native with TypeScript]() and including the following features:

- ESlint (instead of the deprecated TSLint)
- Prettier (with AirBNB config)
- Absolute imports (no `import x from '../../../wx';`)
- VSCode configuration
