# React Native TypeScript Config Demo

A demomnstration project to accompany my blog post RE [Setting up React Native with TypeScript](http://ryannickel.com/html/creating_my_ideal_react_native_projects_with_typescript_eslint,_prettier_and_vscode.html) and including the following features:

- ESlint (instead of the deprecated TSLint)
- Prettier (with AirBNB config)
- Absolute imports (no `import x from '../../../wx';`)
- VSCode configuration
